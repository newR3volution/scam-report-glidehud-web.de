# Scam Report: `glidehud-web.de` (PikePass Toll Scam)

## What This Is

We’re seeing a lot of fake text messages going around, telling people they owe money for using a toll road — like Oklahoma’s **PikePass** system. The message usually says something like:

> “You have an unpaid toll. Please resolve it now: [link]”

That link takes you to a website like `glidehud-web.de`.

This site is **NOT** run by PikePass or any real toll agency.

## What They're Trying to Do

Scammers are:
- **Pretending** to be PikePass (or another toll service)
- Trying to **scare you** into clicking a link
- Asking you to **pay fake toll fees**
- **Stealing your credit card info** or other personal details

---

## Why `glidehud-web.de` is Suspicious

- It ends in `.de` — that’s **Germany’s** web domain, not the U.S.
- PikePass and other real toll sites use **.gov** or trusted domains like `pikepass.com`
- The site likely copies PikePass’s look and logo to fool you
- It’s not listed on any official PikePass website or alert page

---

## What You Should Know

**Real PikePass toll notices:**
- Come by **email** or through your online account
- Will **never** ask for payment in a random text message
- Use **official websites** — not sketchy links

---

## How to Protect Yourself

- **Don’t click** links from random texts about tolls or bills
- **Go directly** to the official PikePass site: [https://www.pikepass.com](https://www.pikepass.com)
- **Report scams** to the FTC: [https://reportfraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov)
- **Tell a friend** — these scams are spreading fast

---

## For the Cybersecurity Curious

- The domain `glidehud-web.de` appears to be a **throwaway phishing site**
- Registered with a **.de TLD**, possibly to dodge U.S. takedown efforts
- Likely part of a **rotating scam kit**, where attackers swap domain names often
- May host **cloned toll pages**, asking for payment and card info
- Could be investigated further via **VirusTotal**, **WHOIS**, or browser sandboxing tools

---

## TL;DR

If you get a text about tolls with a weird link like `glidehud-web.de`, it’s a scam. Delete it. Don’t pay. Tell someone else so they don’t fall for it either.

Stay sharp. You’re the first line of defense.
